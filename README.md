## Overview
- This repository contains some of the code I worked on during my Machine Learning Research Internship at Arizona State University in Summer 2022.
- During the summer, I was primarily working on fitting a parametric model to overoptimistic Machine Learning models. Doing this would ideally yield a 
  better estimate of the model's true accuracy.
 
## Learning Curves
- The file learningcurve.py contains my code for generating learning curves for a Machine Learning model. Learning curves show how 
  the modelâ€™s accuracy changes as a function of sample size.
- Summary of the methodology used to generate the learning curve:
  - Sample data randomly from an n-dimensional Gaussian distribution.
  - Perform feature selection so the most relevant input variables are used.
  - Replicate overoptimism (which occurs when there is overfitting of the data) by performing feature selection on pooled training and testing data.
- The file learningcurve.PNG in the curve-pictures directory shows the learning curve generated by learningcurve.py.

## Curve Fitting
- The file curvefitting.py contains my code for not only generating the learning curve, but also for fitting a parametric equation of the form 
  $aN^{-\alpha} + bN^{-\beta} + c$ to the overoptimistic learning curve.
- The file parametricfitting.PNG in the curve-pictures directory shows how the parametric model fits the overoptimistic learning curve generated by curvefitting.py.
